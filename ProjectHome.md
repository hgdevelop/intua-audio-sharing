## Summary ##

Welcome to the iPhoneOS UIPasteboard developer's page for sharing audio data between applications.

Sample code and the methodology exposed here, offer a straight forward, simple standard for sharing audio data between iPhone OS applications using the UIPasteboard API.

You can get the latest information, example source-code, and contribute to the project from this page.

We hope this method will be widely used as it will improve interactions between iPhone applications giving more flexibility to their end users.


## Scope ##

With the iPhone SDK 3.0, Apple introduced new pasteboard functionalities in the core OS. It is possible to take advantage of the pasteboard for sharing audio data between applications.

This Google Code project is intended to expose this methodology to any developer willing to share audio data between iPhoneOS applications, including BeatMaker.

The methodology fully complies with Apple SDK 3.0+ standards and agreements.
It may be subject to evolutions and changes.

The new Sonoma Wire Works AudioPaste 1.1 protocol is compatible with our standard.
